I am now a first-year research student in DEEP Lab at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Department of Computing, supervised by [Dr. Xiao Huang](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~xiaohuang/index.html "Redirecting to Dr.Huang's homepage"). I received M.S. from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Department of Applied Mathematics in 2022, and B.S. from East China Normal University, Department of Software Engineering in 2020, supervised by [Dr. Xiaoling Wang](https://www.aminer.cn/profile/xiaoling-wang/54488f3ddabfae87b7e43278" Redirecting to Dr.Wang's homepage").
